Identifiers:
=================

* A name in Python program is called identifier.
* It can be class name or function name or module name or variable name.

Rules to define identifiers in Python:
=============================================
1. The only allowed characters in Python are
    * alphabet symbols(either lower case or upper case)
    * digits(0 to 9)
    * underscore symbol(_)
* By mistake if we are using any other symbol like $ then we will get syntax error.

2. Identifier should not starts with digit
3. Identifiers are case sensitive. Of course Python language is case sensitive language.
4. We cannot use reserved words as identifiers
5. There is no length limit for Python identifiers. But not recommended to use too lengthy identifiers.
6. Dollor ($) Symbol is not allowed in Python.
